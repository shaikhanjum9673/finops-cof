# Cost Optimization Framework

## Overview
Schedule non-production instances to shutdown during non-working hours, Cost Optimization Framework (COF) will allow you to schedule the instance shutdown and startup time. COF also provide ability to re-size instances based on their current utilization pattern.


## Pre-requiste

### 1. Instance tagging
Add tag to all the instances which will be shutdown/start using cost optimization framework.
```
shutdown: true
```

### 2. Authentication configuration

In Development environment, authentication is performed via a local YAML configuration file. Stored at default location `~/.cof/csp_auth.yaml` or `.cof/csp_auth.yaml`, however, authentication file path can be supplied at the runtime as script parameter to csp-authentication.sh script.

Authentication YAML format:
```
auth_configs:
  aws:
    access_key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    secret_access_key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    region: <region-name>
    output: json
  azure:
    tenant: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    subscription_id: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    client_id: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    client_secret: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```
> NOTE: You should have AWS and Azure account with appropriate permissions.

### 3. Configure mail server

Ensure mail server is configured on runner instance to send email. Follow instruction documented in [configure-gmail-stmp.md](./docs/configure-gmail-stmp.md) for configuring gmail stmp.

## Usage

### Local execution

Execute init script to either start/stop VMs.

```
init.sh --action stop

init.sh --action start

```

### Schedule using Linux cron
Open a crontab file and configure start/stop schedule

```
# list cron entries
crontab -l

# edit cron entries
crontab -e
```

Instance Shutdown job everyday at 9 PM Mon to Friday.
```
0 8 * * 1-5 cd /opt/cof/latest && init.sh --action start
```

Instance Start job everyday
```
0 21 * * 1-5 cd /opt/cof/latest && init.sh --action stop
```
